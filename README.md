# animeRecommendationSystem
My RGU Honours Project: A system for recommending anime, making use of the MyAnimeList API.

Requires a .env file with your MyAnimeList API Client ID:
```.env
CLIENT_ID=<MY ANIME LIST API CLIENT ID>
```

## Downloading the Data Files
By default, Git does not download the files since they use Git LFS due to how large they are. Therefore, in order to get the data files, you will need to install and use Git LFS, due to the size of the CSV files used in this project.
